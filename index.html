                <h1 id="about">About Adam</h1>
                <p>Adam Plomaritas presents an onslaught of tight, satisfying rock 'n roll, tastefully seasoned with soul and blues. You might say that Mariah Carey, Michael McDonald, and Stevie Wonder all got eaten by a Telecaster-toting grizzly. But perhaps Adam is most aptly described as the most winsome head-snap in the Detroit-metro music scene. His latest release, "The Hard Way", was named #3 album of the year by Ann Arbor Radio's John Bommarito.</p>
                <p>Adam writes infectious tunes with pure-hearted lyrics and rhythms that could rile any dance floor. With an arresting, powerhouse vocal delivery, guitar chops no one can argue with, and a seasoned crew of the best accompanying musicians, Adam brings the party.</p>
                <p>Born, raised, and residing in Ypsilanti, MI, Plomaritas has played the coffee house/bar scene for almost a decade. He has taken the stage with some of the region’s favorite acts: Theo Katzman, Hannah Winkler, Abigail Stauffer, and Wayward Roots, and has even shared the bill with national acts such as The Spring Standards, Switchfoot, and Jason Upton.</p>

            <p id="march">In March of 2012 he released an EP titled “Leave the Light On”. His first single from the EP, “Hard Way”, has received regular airplay on Ann Arbor radio. Off the momentum of “Leave the Light On”, Plomaritas launched a successful Kickstarter campaign to fund the recording of a full length album due out this January.</p>
            <p>The new album is going to be called ‘The Hard Way’ and I’m really proud of it – it is fittingly named”, says Plomaritas. “Not only was the album completely fan funded, we decided to track it almost entirely to analog tape and track everything live, with everybody in the same room, whenever possible. The energy of a real band of people playing instruments in a room together can’t be beat. But it’s tough. All those people have to nail their part to move on to the next tune. To keep that energy high and upbeat at the end of a twelve hour recording session is as rewarding as it is difficult. But when people get the album, they’ll feel the emotion that went into it and I really think they’ll dig it.”</p>

             <blockquote><strong>“Adam Plomaritas may not know it, but he is an old soul. I'm transported back about thirty years when I hear his songs. His warm voice works well on the ballads as well as the rockers he pens. If there's any justice, his reworking of ‘Hard Way’, which appeared on his debut EP, will score him a radio hit.”</strong></blockquote>
            <p>John Bommarito - Ann Arbor's 107.1</p>

            <blockquote><strong>“I love being surprised by an artist. We recently had Adam Plomaritas open for another artist at Trinity House Theatre. I wasn't familiar with his music but left the night a fan of his thoughtful songwriting. He is also a very confident performer and he does a great job engaging the audience. We look forward to having him back to perform.”</strong></blockquote>
            <p>Bill Keith - Trinity House Theatre</p>

            <blockquote><strong>“Adam Plomaritas is simply amazing….He as been a featured artist here [Ann Street Music Room] on more than one occasion and has hit the ball out of the park every time! He is musically adept, his voice ranges from sweet to just plain grit in your gut and his lyrics will charm you before you know it. All that and a great stage presence to keep you entertained. I always look forward to a show I know Adam is playing.”</strong></blockquote>
            <p>Jeff Comella - Ann Street Music Room</p>

            <blockquote><strong>“Simply smooth and inviting. Energetic and Engaging. Adam   P. is true performer.”</strong></blockquote>
